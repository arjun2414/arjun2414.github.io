											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Hello! My Name is Arjun Athian and I am a third year Computer Science major at Virginia Tech.
										</p>
										<p>
											I am a F-1 International Student from India who moved to the United States when I was 7 years old and currently I reside in Memphis, Tennessee.
										</p>
										<p>
											I am yet to obtain my first internship experience as I only gained clearance to work in the US in the
											Spring of 2019 but I am very thankful to be able to work as an undergraduate researcher at Virginia Tech during the Fall of 2020. However, I do believe
											that I have gained the skills necessary to take on my first opportunity in the computer science field through my work inside and outside classroom. 
										</p>
										<p>
											My interests include Data Analytics, Web Development, Human-Computer Interaction, and Software Engineering but currently I haven't specialized
											in any of these areas and am still open to other aspects of the computer science field.
										</p>
										<p>
											Outside of Computer Science I enjoy working out, watching and playing sports, and being with my friends and family.
